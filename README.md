# Dice-Rolling-Simulator-Game-in-Python
In this python project we will be imitating a roller dice.  It will generate random number of each dice the program runs & the user use the dice repeatedly for long time as he wants when the user rows a dice the program generates a number, random number between 1 to 6 on a standard dice right the number will then be displayed to the user
it will also ask user if they like to roll dice again. The program should also include a function that can randomly graph a number within 1 to 6 and print it.
